      <p>What's up! I'm Selemun, an Eritrean born, Central District raised, up and coming programmer. I'm native to Seattle and currently work in IT as a Systems Support Analyst at Perkins Coie law firm in downtown. I've been there for two years, starting my career as an intern in the Info Sec department. I'm attending Epicodus' night class learning Web Development. I've always had a passion for coding, I'd always imagine the code behind applications. I attended ITT Tech a few years back but due to financial cirsis could not complete my education. But, I was first introduced to coding there, and I've kept it in my mind to end up down that path in my career. I'm currently working on building my portfolio. Continue below for some of the work I've completed so far.</p>
