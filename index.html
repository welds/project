        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>What's up! I'm Selemun, an Eritrean born, Central District raised, up and coming programmer. I'm native to Seattle and currently work in IT as a Systems Support Analyst at Perkins Coie law firm in downtown. I've been there for two years, starting my career as an intern in the Info Sec department. I'm attending Epicodus' night class learning Web Development. I've always had a passion for coding, I'd always imagine the code behind applications. I attended ITT Tech a few years back but due to financial cirsis could not complete my education. But, I was first introduced to coding there, and I've kept it in my mind to end up down that path in my career. I'm currently working on building my portfolio. Continue below for some of the work I've completed so far.</p>

        <h1>My work so far</h1>
        <p>These are the few projects I have under my belt, <em>so far</em>.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong><a href="../my-firs-webpage-master/my-first-webpage.html">My First Webpage</strong></a></li>
            <p>This is the first webpage we created in class. My partner and I wanted to have a pitbull picture to counter all the kitten pictures we see daily online.</p>
            <li><strong><a href="../my-firs-webpage-master/favorite-things.html">My Favorite Things</strong></a></li>
            <p>This is the second site we built, and it was a list some favorite characters and ice cream flavors. We used CSS styles from bootstrap to align the wbepage to the center. There's only a few colored items on this page, both are headers.</p>
            <li><strong><a href="../my-firs-webpage-master/favorite-places.html">Vacation Spots Around The Word</strong></a></li>
            <p>This is my favorite webpage, it lists all the places my partner and I thought would be great to visit. We also used the boostrap stylesheet here to create row and columns that adjust according to screen viewed on or browser size. If you move the browser to the left, the rows collapse below eachother, maintaining their dimensions.</p>
            <li></li>

        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>On my free time I like to spend my time with family and friends, or by myself working on side projects. Here are some of the projects I've worked on before, in front and behind the camera.</p>
        <p>In 2012, a group of friends and I worked on a movie to capture our neighborhood in history. It was base on two youth struggling to find batters for an old school keyboard, so that the protagonist can have one last session with his brother before he is deported.
